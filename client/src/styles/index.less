/* UTIl
//
// The util/ folder gathers all less tools and helpers we’ll use across the project. Got a function? A mixin?
// Put it in there. This folder also contains a var.less file (sometimes config.less) which holds all global variables
// for the project (for typography, color schemes, and so on)

/* BASE
//
// The base/ folder holds what we might call the boilerplate stuff for your project. In there, you might find the reset
// (or Normalize.css, or whatever), probably some stuff dealing with typography, and, depending on the project, maybe
// some other files.

/* LAYOUT
//
// The layout/ directory (sometimes called partials/) usually contains a number of files, each of them setting some
// styles for the main sections of the layout (header, footer, and so on).

@import "layout/btn";

/* COMPONENT
//
// For smaller components, there is the components/ folder (frequently called modules/). While layout/ is kind of macro
// (defining the global wireframe), components/ is more micro. It can contain all kinds of specific modules
// like a slider, a loader, a widget, or anything along those lines. There are usually a lot of files in components/
// since your site is should be mostly composed of tiny modules.
*/


/* SCREENS
//
// If you have screen-specific styles, I think it’s cool to put them in a screen/ folder and in a file named after
// the screen. For example, it’s not uncommon to have very specific styles for the "Deposit screen", so you’d have
// a deposit.less file in screen/ dealing with this.
